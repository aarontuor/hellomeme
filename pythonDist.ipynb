    "# Writing and Distributing Open Source Python Software\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through the steps to make a distributable python package, host the package on github, distribute the package on PyPi, the Python Package Index, write documentation for your package, and host the docs on readthedocs. The instructions are for Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit operating systems. This is a bare bones introduction which should provide you with the essential info for getting started distributing software. The online literature for each aspect of distributing python software can be pretty daunting. I've included links to the clearest and most concise treatments I've found on the separate topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial you will need to set up (free) accounts for Github, PyPi, and ReadTheDocs linked to a common email address if you don't already have these accounts set up. You can find instructions at the links below:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Github: <https://github.com/join>\n",
    "+ ReadTheDocs: <https://readthedocs.org/accounts/signup/>\n",
    "+ PyPi: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markup languages\n",
    "\n",
    "reStructuredText and Markdown are lightweight markup languages used for documentation among other things. This tutorial is written in Markdown. The docs for the toy python package used for demonstration are written in rSt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out more about these common markup languages see the links below:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ reStructuredText: <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>\n",
    "+ Markdown: <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Version Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of python users is currently split between python2 and python3, which have some compatibility issues.\n",
    "If you want your code accessible to the greatest number of people you should try to write python code that is\n",
    "backwards/forwards compatible. Here is a link to some tools to help with the compatibility issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip and Virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is the tool that is used by PyPi to distribute python software. Sometimes it is good to install new python software in a virtual environment to make sure that it doesn't conflict with the core python distribution of your OS.\n",
    "To install pip and virtualenv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to need git installed on your machine. git is version control software used by github which acts as a central repository for your software. You can learn more about git here <https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/>. To install git: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install git\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Packages and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A python **module** is simply a .py file with reusable python functions and classes.\n",
    "A python **package** is folder that contains a collection of python modules and packages that has a special `__init__.py` file at the top level. This file can simply be blank which is considered good practice, but can also be used to share code between the package's subpackages and modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an in depth explanation of python packages and modules see here <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Modules_and_Packages>\n",
    "\n",
    "## helloMyName\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a toy software package which is just complicated enough to explain the basics of package distribution,\n",
    "but simple enough to still be able to understand what is going on. You should clone this package from github.\n",
    "From the command line, in the directory where you want the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/aarontuor/helloMyName.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I made this package following the minimal structure tutorial found here <http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I've already set up helloMyName on github, pypi, and readthedocs. \n",
    "Let's set up a virtual environment to install helloMyName and run it's limited utility in a python terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir ~/pythonDist\n",
    "$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/pythonDist\n",
    "$ source ~/pythonDist/bin/activate\n",
    "$ pip install helloMyName\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "> from helloMyName import welcome\n",
    "> welcome.hi(8, mood='depressed', verbose=True)\n",
    "hello world! I am depressed to be a program.\n",
    "I am veeeeery depressed to meet you\n",
    "8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't do much but it is freely distributed software!\n",
    "\n",
    "## helloYourName\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use the code you have cloned to make your own distribution!\n",
    "First let's get rid of everything that was specific to my distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First let's change the helloMyName folders by replacing 'MyName' with your name or whatever you like. From now on in this document I'll refer to whatever you replaced 'MyName' with as 'YourName'. So where ever you see the string of characters 'YourName' you should replace with whatever you replaced the characters 'MyName' with. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now in the top level helloYourName folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ rm -rf docs\n",
    "$ rm -rf dist\n",
    "$ rm -rf .git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "helloYourName has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "helloYourName # top level of distribution\n",
    "    setup.py # for installing the package\n",
    "    README.rst # for package's github homepage\n",
    "    helloYourName # package\n",
    "        __init__.py # so python knows this is a package\n",
    "        welcome.py # the module of reusable python functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our distributed code contains one package and one module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the contents of setup.py, the code that is used to install your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### setup.py\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n",
    "\n",
    "setup(name='helloMyname',\n",
    "      version=0.02,\n",
    "      description='Python package example',\n",
    "      url='http://mywebsite',\n",
    "      author='myname',\n",
    "      author_email='tuora@students.wwu.edu',\n",
    "      license='none',\n",
    "      packages=find_packages(), # or list of package paths from this directory\n",
    "      zip_safe=False,\n",
    "      install_requires=[],\n",
    "      classifiers=['Programming Language :: Python'],\n",
    "      keywords=['Package Distribution'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll wan't to change the name, url, author, and author_email arguments for your package. Also you probably want an open source license in the top level directory of helloYourName. A guide to open source licenses can be found here <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/license/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install this package manually by running the setup.py script with either a 'develop' or 'install' argument.\n",
    "Assuming you are in the virtual environment we set up and in the top level directory of helloYourName if you run: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python setup.py develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a symlink to the source code will be copied to the directory ~/pythonDist/lib/python2.7/site-packages/helloYourName.\n",
    "If you use 'install' instead of 'develop' all the source in helloYourName will be copied to this location instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed introduction to basic info about setup.py files look here: <http://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documenting with Sphinx\n",
    "\n",
    "We will automatically generate most of our documentation from python doc-strings using Sphinx, the python documentation generator. So we need to install Sphinx. I recommend a virtual environment for installing Sphinx but it\n",
    "isn't strictly necessary. In the top level directory of helloYourName: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild # installs Sphinx\n",
    "$ mkdir docs \n",
    "$ cd docs\n",
    "$ sphinx-quickstart # populates docs directory with basic sphinx docs build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you will be asked a series of questions to customize your initial docs build. Many of these you can just hit enter and choose the default. Some information you must provide, such as the project name (helloYourName), the author name (YourName), the project version (0.1), and the project release (0.1.1). Version numbers typically have two numbers separated by a decimal and release numbers have the version number and some release qualifier after another decimal. There are many lengthy discussions online about version and release numbers. The most straightforward can be found here <http://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html>. Basically each new version and release should have a larger number. So, start small and work your way up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions which you should answer yes to so that important extensions are enabled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: y \n",
    "\u001bdoctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: y \n",
    "mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: y\n",
    "viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: y\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can make your first docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ make html # makes html files in docs/_build/html/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the framework of your documentation is set up! You can view these docs at helloYourName/docs/_build/html/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sphinx documentation is pretty dense and bewildering but you can find it here <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>."
